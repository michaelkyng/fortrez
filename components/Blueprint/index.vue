                Fortrez, a blockchain-based platform for charitable donations
                would ensure transparency and security. With blockchain, every
                donation transaction is recorded and verified by multiple
                participants, making it hard to manipulate or tamper with the
                data. This would help Fortrez build trust among donors and
                recipients, as they can easily track where their donations are
                going. Plus, the decentralized nature of blockchain reduces the
                risk of fraud and corruption. It's an awesome way to make sure
                charitable donations are used for their intended purpose!
